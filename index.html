			<div id="intro-text"><h2>About eight years ago I went to Indonesia with a group of my silat school. We stayed there for a couple of weeks, and in those weeks we trained everyday. The lessons with our big group and the group from the school there, started each day the same. We greet each other. Then everybody had to sit down, close their eyes and listen to the teacher, who was saying the Satria Muda Indonesia (SMI) promise out loud. And then the lesson will start. </h2><h2>Of course the first few days were all about getting to know each other and trying to understand what the teacher meant with his jurus <span class="circle"><span class="source">Jurus is a position / stance, you can compare it with a kata from karate. It’s a fixed movement within the style you are practicing.</span> </span> and lessons. He showed the movement once or twice and then let us practice it. He didn’t correct us, walked around and was looking at how we’re moving. At some point he did start to correct me, explaining what the movement all was about. And after a couple of days me and my training-partner had to train two times a day. While the others only could train in the evening with the rest. That went on until the day we had to get back to the Netherlands. </h2></div>

That went on until the day we had to get back to the Netherlands. </p>
			<p>For me, this short period in which I got to learn so much techniques worked out very well. I enjoyed the way of teaching. But when I think back, it didn’t work out so well for the rest. He didn’t criticise their techniques as must as he did with me and my training-partner. He let them practice the same jurus over and over again. And at some point some people of our group started to ‘miss’ classes. Which is, in my eyes, disrespectful towards the teacher. So when they did came back to train, he was following the promise of SMI: you will follow the training with discipline & the knowledge gained will only be taught back to those who are entitled. So he didn’t teach them but let his assistant help them. In his eyes they were not entitled to learn his techniques, because of the lack of respect and discipline. But from their perspective it’s understandable, in their eyes the teacher didn’t pay enough attention to them.</p>
			<p>I tried his way of teaching here in the Netherlands with some of the children/students I teach, and have seen that sometimes the same thing happens as in Indonesia. The children/students did not have a ‘goal’ to train too. It made me realise that both views/mindsets have their flaws. What flaws? The students are thrown in the deep by the teacher. Which is okay, if there is clear guidance. But he expects that the students find the answers to their questions by practicing the movement x amount of times. While students think they are doing the exercise correct, because they don’t get critique on the way they perform, the teacher doesn’t find them ready enough to continue to the next step/technique. That’s why in Asia it could take years even decades to obtain the black belt. I think it is okay if you “find the answers” by practicing non-stop, but at some point you do need to get guidance on what you are doing. (It should be taught in such a way that it’s useful in all things.) <span class="circle"><span class="source">“The true science of martial arts means to train in such a way that they will be useful at any time. And to teach in such a way that they will be useful in all things.” - The Book of Five Rings (五輪書 Go Rin no Sho) by Miyamoto Musashi, 1645.</span> </span></p>
			<p>So how can we combine those two mindsets as one, in a way that works best for you? Not only for training a martial art or other sport, but more importantly for your daily life and especially for your work as a designer/artist. That in the end this mindset is repeated so many times (subconsciously & consciously), like the movements, you’ll have balanced your mind. We master the technical aspects of an art form only by learning the rules and the ways that people have done things in the past. It takes a great deal of flexibility of mind to then question these rules, to push on them, and to break free from the influence of one's teachers.</br>(This goes for both pencak silat and graphic design)</p>
